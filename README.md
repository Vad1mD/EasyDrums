# EasyDrums

EasyDrums is a project developed as a college graduation project. It is a system designed to detect drum stick movements and calculate their velocity using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Detects drum stick movements based on color detection.
- Calculates the velocity of the drum sticks.
- Determines the volume based on the velocity.
- Draws drum areas on a given matrix.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EasyDrums.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd EasyDrums
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary classes from the `Tools.py` file:
    ```python
    from Drum_system.Tools import Stick, Drums
    ```
2. Create instances of the `Stick` and `Drums` classes and use their methods as needed.
